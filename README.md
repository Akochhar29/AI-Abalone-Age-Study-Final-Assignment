# AI-Abalone-Age-Study-Final-Assignment

Abalones are animals in the family Haliotidae and are considered 'marine snails'.  Scientists have discovered that there is a correlation with the age of abalones and the amount of rings that they have. Usually, an abalone's age is calculated using the amount of rings that they have +1.5 to get their age.  In this study, the correlation between the amount of rings an abalone has and multiple features such as weight, size etc. are observed through a linear regression.
